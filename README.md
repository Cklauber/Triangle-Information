# Triangle-Information
This is a UWP project where we can check if the values of three sides make it a valid triangle. If positive, it will check what type of triangle it is.
This project uses the MVVM pattern since I believe it is a very nice pattern that helps to apply the SOLID principles, espcially the single responsibility principle.

Currently the fields to enter the value for each side only accepts integers, but the project is easily escalable to work with decimals.

The types of triangles it knows are:
 Right
 Equilateral
 Isosceles
 Triangle(for every other triangle)

To get started just clone the project, open the .sln file and start the application.

Thank you.
